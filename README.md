# web Resource Catalogus

Description
----
The WRC contains the resources needed to run an application such as templates, routing, menus and images. Its objective is to act as a "headless CMS" or a CMS as an API that is independent of any form of display. The WRC therefore relies on the Dashboard (an implementation of the Proto Application) for editing the CMS content, and it itself functions as a source for an Application.

By keeping storage and editing separate, it is possible to manage the content of multiple applications from one dashboard. This provides a better overview, so a template could also be used in various applications and websites. This is useful, for example, with general information or FAQ’s

An added advantage of the WRC is that it supports multilingualism on resources and that makes it possible to create and manage content in multiple languages. It also provides insight into which content has already been translated and which content has not yet been translated, and compliance with the WCAG standard for bilingualism is monitored.

With regard to design, the WRC offers two important functionalities to applications, first of all, templates can be “extended”. This means, for example, that an application could make use of NL Design, but can add its own flavor to it via the WRC. Because the WRC can share between applications, it is also possible for an organization to use one consistent corporate identity for multiple applications. In addition, the WRC offers the possibility of CDN, or moving static content from an application to an external source. This makes the data traffic on an application itself lower and therefore faster. It also means that at application level, logic and static content can be pulled apart and physically placed on other (specialized) machines.

Installation
----
We differentiate between two way's of installing this component, a local installation as part of the provided developers toolkit or an [helm](https://helm.sh/) installation on an development or production environment.

#### Local installation
First make sure you have [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) running on your computer. Then clone the repository to a directory on your local machine through a [git command](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone) or [git kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) (ui for git). If successful you can now navigate to the directory of your cloned repository in a command prompt and execute docker-compose up.
```CLI
$ docker-compose up
```
This will build the docker image and run the used containers and when seeing the log from the php container: "NOTICE: ready to handle connections", u are ready to view the documentation at localhost on your preferred browser.

#### Instalation on Kubernetes or Haven
As a haven compliant commonground component this component is installable on kubernetes trough helm. The helm files can be found in the api/helm folder. For installing this component trough helm simply open your (still) favorite command line interface and run
```CLI
$ helm install [name] ./api/helm --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml --namespace [name] --set settings.env=prod,settings.debug=0,settings.cache=1
```
For an in depth installation guide you can refer to the [installation guide](INSTALLATION.md), it also contains a short tutorial on getting your cluster ready to expose your installation to the world

Developers toolkit and technical information
----
We make our datamodels with the tool [modelio](https://www.modelio.org) which can be found along the OAS documentation and the postman collection in api/public/schema.
If you need development support we provide that through the [samenorganiseren slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/samenorganiseren/shared_invite/zt-dex1d7sk-wy11sKYWCF0qQYjJHSMW5Q).

Couple of quick tips when you start developing
- If you haven't setup the component locally read the Installion part for setting up your local environment.
- You can find the other components on [Github](https://github.com/ConductionNL).
- Take a look at the [commonground componenten catalogus](https://componentencatalogus.commonground.nl/componenten?) to prevent development collitions.
- Use [Commongroun.conduction.nl](https://commonground.conduction.nl/) for easy deployment of test environments to deploy your development to.
- For information on how to work with the component you can refer to the tutorial [here](TUTORIAL.md).
